tl;dr Watch me stumble through machine learning software tutorials on Tuesdays at 6 PM Eastern.

After testing the streaming capabilities and getting some good feedback, I'm settling on Tuesday nights 6-7 PM Eastern US time for regular broadcasting.  Archive videos will be posted to YouTube if you can't make the stream.  And even still, you can post in the chat, and I'll see it later.

When time and opportunity allows, I may stream at other times.  I'll try to post here in that case.
