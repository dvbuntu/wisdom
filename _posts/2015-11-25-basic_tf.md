After the fumbling around [last time]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015/11/17/more_tensor/), I found a more basic introduction to TensorFlow.  This time, instead of embarking blindly on a machine learning task, I simply got more comfortable with the library, learning a few things along the way.

One of the cool things I learned worth repeating here is that you can substitute in your own values for arbitrary variables inside a TensorFlow graph.  Normally, you use `tf.placeholder` type variables for your inputs, but you can supply (via `feed_dict`) input to change `tf.Varable` and `tf.constant` values as well.  This, combined with interactive sessions allows for better debugging, sanity checking, and simple model exploration when building up a model.  I still have plenty of training to go to beat into my head that most TF lines define part of the graph, then `sess.run` actually executes it.  But it's starting to make sense.
