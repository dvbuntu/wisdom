If you recall my [initial video]({{ site.baseurl }}//2015/11/13/tensor_flow.md), I was irritated that TensorFlow had been released only for Python2.  Well, after much hard work, Google ported TF to Python3!  This week's stream is me reliving the joys of installing TensorFlow, but now for Python3.  Watch me make a fool of myself struggling with Docker, `pip`, and GPUs.

As noted in the comments on the video, I did eventually succeed with Docker and giving myself 5 minutes outside of streaming.  That's just one of the dangers of being live, that I can't really take a break to read.  It wouldn't be very entertaining or informative to you guys.  At least if I'm failing, that's hopefully amusing and gives you some confidence :p
