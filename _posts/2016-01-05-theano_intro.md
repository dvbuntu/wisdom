I'm back from my break and onto a new machine learning framework, [Theano](deeplearning.net/software/theano).  On the surface, it's similar to TensorFlow in that you describe a graph of computations to be compiled and executed.  Sadly for those entertained by me royally screwing up, installation with pip was a breeze and I worked through many "Baby Steps" tutorials.

Next week I'll continue exploring Theano for more advanced analyses.  Also, due to a request from chat, I'll look into creating a new video on how to setup and use my [workflow](http://dvbuntu.github.io/compute/).
