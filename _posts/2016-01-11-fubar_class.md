This February 11th at 7 PM, I'll be live at [FUBAR Labs](fubarlabs.org) in New Jersey to guide a workshop on "Data Visualization and Machine Learning".  I'll be showing people how to get started with Python plotting and visualization using [SageMathCloud](cloud.sagemath.com) as well as describing some of today's mystifying topics in the world of data science.  [RSVP on Meetup](meetup.com/FUBAR-Labs-Hackerspace-in-New-Brunswick/events/227951341/) or show up at the door. 

Also, I'm now on Twitter [@DanDoesData](twitter.com/DanDoesData)!  It's another way to say hi or explain how I'm doing everything wrong.
