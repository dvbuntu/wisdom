Progress continues with Theano as I try out the MNIST dataset.  Their tutorial walks through building a generic logistic regression; I probably should have just made a more one-off solution.  Maybe it's just the nature of the tutorial, but this felt more natural when doing it in TensorFlow.  And unlike neural nets, I'm very familiar with logistic regression.

Like always, I managed to introduce some stupid bugs during the stream.  15 minutes after shutting it down, I found my error and produced reasonable results.
