Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) are where machine learning really starts to ramp up the challenge in understanding.  Accordingly, more of this video is spent explaining rather than coding.  That unforunately means I didn't actually build much in the way of CNNs.  I think next week I'll try to do a walkthrough of a simple MNIST example, carefully explaining each step.  It's like one of my mantras

```
Anything I understand is trivially simple.
Anything I don't is hopelessly complex.
