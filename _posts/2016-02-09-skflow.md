[TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) is pretty cool, but if you want a higher-level interface, you should checkout [skflow](github.com/tensorflow/skflow).  `skflow` lets you quickly specify common machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic classification, and of course neural nets (of various flavors).  What makes it so easy to use is that it abstracts away a lot of the variable initialization and handling required for lower-level libraries like TensorFlow or Theano.  You can literally specify a Deep Neural Net in one line of code.

```python
classifier = skflow.TensorFlowDNNClassifier(hidden_units=[15,20,25,15], n_classes = len(mnist['target_names'])
```

If you're familiar with [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), the interface is designed to feel very similar.  And while `skflow` is nominally for educational purposes to get you up to speed with TensorFlow, I have a feeling many people will still make some impressive models.
