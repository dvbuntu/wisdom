Since the last video, Keras officially released version 1.0, woohoo!  In this video, I poked around at some of the new features and changed syntax.  Most of it is pretty much the same.  The big change was that "Graph" objects are now "Functional" objects.  I think I preferred the old name, but I never got around to using it, so I don't get a vote.

I also tried to get a simple RNN running again, but the data just isn't lining up for this.  I think I need to find a minimal example, with the data spelled out, to see what my problem is.  I need a "DanDoesData" for RNNs :p

I think I've goofed off with Keras enough for now, and it's time to move on to another topic.  Several viewers have sent in suggestions, so I'll pick one of those from a hat.
