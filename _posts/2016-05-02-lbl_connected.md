This week launched a new series, "Line By Line".  By viewer request, I walked through the excruciating details of TensorFlow's `fully_connected_feed.py` script.  It has a lot of little components that can trip you up if you're not used to seeing them.

The upside of this kind of video is that it's hard to totally screw up since it's vetted existing code.  On the flip side, I can only do this with something I know really well.  In this case, I've done the MNIST example in my sleep, so it's not a problem.  If you've got other tutorials or topics you'd like exposed, let me know!
