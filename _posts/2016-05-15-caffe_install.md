Last week, I attempted to install yet another machine learning framework, [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).  While it does include Python bindings, the default interface seems to be model specification via a JSON file and running from the command line.

This library is one of the more fragile installation procedures.  While I tried to compile it, nothing seemed to work.  That may be my Arch Linux system acting up.  After the stream, I settled for using a Docker container.
