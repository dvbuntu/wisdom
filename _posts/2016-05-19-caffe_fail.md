Caffe and I just don't get along it seems.  Though I gave in and used the Python2 Docker image for caffe, I could not get basic models to run.  This was supposed to be a CPU-only image, but all the failure cited CUDA problems.

I wanted to check out Caffe since it was another machine learning library that I heard a lot about, but never tried.  But I guess it just wasn't meant to be.  Next week, it's a fresh new research problem; "Dan (actually) Does Data", for once.
