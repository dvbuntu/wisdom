Ah, Recurrent Neural Networks.  So natural to describe ("Use some features computed previously in this computation too!"), but always tricky to implement in the proper libraries.  I took a whack at it this time, with mixed results.

I believe I have a simple RNN working with just a single frame of lookback.  At least, based on the number of parameters, I think that's what must be happening.  It's always a little hard to tell if I'm loading the data correctly for these kinds of models.

I also learned about [TimeDistributed](https://keras.io/layers/core/#timedistributeddense) layers, which can ease some of the burden of implementing more complex RNNs by handling the multiple inputs to each time.  This would have been useful when doing [Font Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSpPJtenw_c), but at least doing it "manually", I understood exactly what was happening.  Tradeoffs of using libraries.
