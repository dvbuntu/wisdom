Every time I install a machine learning library, I complain about the "Jenga tower of dependencies" to make everything work.  This time, I nearly ate my words as I demonstrated setting up and using *my own* custom data science workflow.  But, it all worked out in the end.  The gears of IPython, tmux, vim, and slimux all meshed beautifully to produce an elegant workflow, even in the pure terminal environment.

Of course, my workflow is described in much greater detail over at [my other site](https://dvbuntu.github.io/compute).  I still plan to publish that as a proper ebook at some point, but still need to do more editing.  If you'd like to see it commercially available, let me know!
