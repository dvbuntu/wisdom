It's a very special stream this week because it's Valentine's Day.  To celebrate, let's explore data from a data website.   While I couldn't find recommendation dating on short notice, I did find a general [set of anonymized profiles](https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid).  This provides a framework for test-driving less flashy machine learning python libraries like [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Sci-kit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Because we're looking at more "traditional" libraries, the analysis sticks with exploratory data mining and some light regression.  No Deep Learning here.  That doesn't mean the models are weak; you should use the simplest model you can get away with, and often, linear regression fits the bill.
