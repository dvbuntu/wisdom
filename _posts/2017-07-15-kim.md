My latest video course, [Keras In Motion](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/keras-in-motion), is now live at Manning Publications.  You may have heard me mention this "other project" in the stream over the past 6 months or so; it's been taking up a lot of my free time.  The course itself is a walkthrough of the Keras library using [real](https://github.com/dvbuntu/for_well_thou_kn) [applied](https://github.com/dvbuntu/autonomous) [projects](https://github.com/dvbuntu?tab=repositories).  It's really a great course, with the live construction of the streaming videos, but with a scripted, edited, final product for cleanliness.  If you've enjoyed my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/dvbuntu), I think you'll like the content and structure of this course.  Plus, if you use the code, `vlboxeltw`, you can get a great discount.

So am I doing anything else on my sabbatical besides selling videos?  I've been traveling, doing some sightseeing, and trying to decompress.  But also, trying to live more simply for awhile.  I had accumulated a long of stuff, so while traveling, it's actually nice to live with less for awhile.  Something about the scrimping, saving, and scavenging for basic household goods is a bit of fun.  Maybe, like a video game, it's the continual "upgrade" of basic tools possible when starting from nothing again.

One thing I'm glad to have back is a high-speed internet connection.  I was operating on purely mobile data for awhile, which in addition to being slow, is paid by the byte.  Even if it weren't more expensive, the psychological toll of knowing every bit of data is costing me limited my connectivity.  That's good and bad for decompressing, but now I'm glad to be a part of the 21st century again.
