I'm **Danielle Van Boxel**, mild-mannered data scientist by day, and snarky critiquer by night.  I cut my statistical chops on [econometric models for transportation data analysis](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~flm/CE614%2813%29.htm) before "data science" was a hot buzzword.  Now I'm a [PhD student at the University of Arizona Applied Math Program](https://appliedmath.arizona.edu/person/danielle-van-boxel).  This is my little corner of the Internet to examine recent statistical research, stream new interactive workflow techniques, demonstrate data science frameworks, and sometimes even muse on other topics.  Hopefully we all learn something!

I used to stream on [YouTube Live](http://www.youtube.com/c/DanVanBoxel/live) every Tuesday evening 6-7 PM Eastern.  Watch me step through machine learning software tutorials like TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch.  It's like "Let's Play" for data analysis.

Check out my [Video Course](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-learning-tensorflow-video) on learning [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for machine learning.  It teaches you TensorFlow by working through a novel font recognition project created just for this course.

I am also available for data consulting for projects large and small.  In particular, I love to teach people how to improve their workflow.  I want to help your corporate division, new startup, or graduate department.  If there's a topic you'd like me to discuss or a diatribe you have to send me, feel free to drop me a line at <mailto:the.dvb@gmail.com>.  

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with posts written in [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  Comments are provided by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), while video streaming is on Google Hangouts or UStream (with videos saved to Youtube for later viewing).

I also run a static book/website devoted to developing a customized workflow for data analysis.  [Check it out](https://dvbuntu.github.io/compute).
