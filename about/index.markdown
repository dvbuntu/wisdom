I'm **Dan Van Boxel**, mild-mannered data scientist by day, and snarky critiquer by night.  I cut my statistical chops on [econometric models for transportation data analysis](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~flm/CE614%2813%29.htm) before "data science" was a hot buzzword.  This is my little corner of the Internet to examine recent statistical research, stream new interactive workflow techniques, demonstrate data science frameworks, and sometimes even muse on other topics.  Hopefully we all learn something!

I stream on [YouTube Live](http://www.youtube.com/c/DanVanBoxel/live) every Tuesday evening 6-7 PM Eastern.  Watch me bumble through machine learning software tutorials like TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch.  It's like "Let's Play" for data analysis.

I am also available for data consulting for projects large and small.  In particular, I love to teach people how to improve their workflow.  I want to help your corporate division, new startup, or graduate department.  If there's a topic you'd like me to discuss or a diatribe you have to send me, feel free to drop me a line at <mailto:the.dvb@gmail.com>.  

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with posts written in [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  Comments are provided by [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), while video streaming is on Google Hangouts or UStream (with videos saved to Youtube for later viewing).

I also run a static book/website devoted to developing a customized workflow for data analysis.  [Check it out](https://dvbuntu.github.io/compute).
